# Host Role

Hey, so you wanna be a host?

The host is responsible for announcing the event, reminding the group, opening the space, welcoming newbies, and faciltating check-ins, and closing the space.

Yes Art~Hack is a collective, and delegating is good, but while paticipants can optionally contribute as they desire, the host is the backstop who must be ultimately responsible.

introducing art~hack wellington's weekly jam: a safe space to discover, create, and share creative solarpunk energies with other (shy & introverted) humans. üåà

every thursday we share a mostly unstructured evening of make-believe, of hanging-out-and-ignoring-each-other, of intertwingling. bring whatever is your thing! maybe a side project, maybe a beat in your head, maybe a conversation, maybe some electronics, maybe a notebook, maybe a costume, your art can be anything. ‚ù§Ô∏è

if you're new and/or need to be let in the front door, say hi to the event host.

## The day of, remind the group on Signal

```

## At 6pm, open the space

Before 6pm, arrive at the space to prepare for arrivals.

Check the space is suitably arranged (couches, tables, and such in the right places) and tidy (surfaces clear).

At 6pm, prop open the door and put out the sign.

## As newbies arrive, welcome them

As newbies arrive, greet them and say hello!

Try to help them feel welcome and at home in our (sometimes awkward and intimidating) space.

## At 7pm, facilitate check-ins

At 7pm, gather the group energy and cast the check-in spell.

4 questions:

1. What's your name?
2. How are you feeling?
3. What's on top creatively for you? (projects on the go)
4. Do you have anything to share? (performance / show and tell)

## At the end, close the space

When the event comes to a close, prepare the space for departure.

- Collect dirty dishes
- Wash dishes (or empty a dishwasher, put them in a dishwasher, and run the dishwasher)
- Move couches, tables, and such back to their original positions
- Ensure any gear used is returned back to original state
